## Technologies Used

    - Linux Operating System (Ubuntu)
    - Netwide assembler
    - GNU C Compiler
    - GNU Linker
    - QEMU - System i386
    - GNU Make
    - genisoimage

## Features

This OS was in implementation from the boilerplate given by sister20. In this OS you can use simple command like `cat` to read file, `ls` to list file and many more. To see more command check the command section. This OS is made using bcc, bochs, c, and asm. 

## Program Features

4. cd
5. cp
6. cat
7. ls
8. mv
9. mkdir

3. `mkdir <folder_name>` - to create new folder in current dir

6. `cp <file> <target>` - copy file to target dir if no folder exists will rename to target
